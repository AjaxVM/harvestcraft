HarvestCraft 1.12b
-----------------
- Even more recipes fixed (Thank you BrickWaffle!!!!!)


HarvestCraft 1.12a
-----------------
- Most if not all recipes should be fixed now! (HUGE THANKS TO Syndaryl!!!!!)
- Known Bug: Fruit Blocks are still weird in Creative Menu only
- Not a Bug: Some config options that relate to recipes no longer work because you can delete un-wanted recipe JSON files yourself.  Will remove unworking config options later.

HarvestCraft 1.12 Alpha
-----------------
WARNING:  ALL RECIPES ARE BROKEN except smelting and presser

- Known Bug: Fruit Blocks are showing up in the Creative menu with broken textures; this only affects the Creative menu and nothing in game
- Removed: Block: Crate from code, will not be coming back
- Added: Code: Add missing Forge event hooks to BlockCrops growth updates (thanks TheAtomicOption)
