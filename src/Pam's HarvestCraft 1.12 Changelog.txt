HarvestCraft 1.12.2b
-----------------
- Added: Config: topTierFood (Default: 10): This new config option defines which foods are considered top tier.  Choose between 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 for minimum number of shanks a food restores that become top tier.  Set to 0 to have no top tier foods.  Warning: Top Tier foods can ALWAYS BE EATEN so be careful you don't waste them.  Example: If you pick 5, any food that restores 5 or more shanks become top tier and give buffs.
- Added: Top Tier Foods (those who meet the topTierFood threshold) now give multiple buffs upon eating.  All foods defined as top tier give the same buffs to allow diet variety.  Buffs given are Strength and Resistance.
